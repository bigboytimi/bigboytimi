 <!-- About section -->

---
🤔 Problem-solver by day, playlist virtuoso by night. I'm a code monkey with a mission to elevate the human experience through technology.

🛠️ Skills: Product & Data Engineering. 

💪 Proficiency: Java, Python, SQL, Apache Spark, Kafka, AWS.

🧠 Passion: Building innovative products that seamlessly merge functionality and user delight. I'm not just here to code; I'm here to create experiences that make people say, "Wow, I didn't know tech could do that!"

🧬 DNA: Part tech wizard, part relentless optimist. I believe in the power of technology to not only solve problems but also unlock human potential. Think self-cleaning coffee mugs, AI therapists who truly listen, and robots that tackle those laundry piles for you. (Hey, a techie can dream, right?)

⚡ Fun Fact: I'm a Founding Stories enthusiast, constantly absorbing the journeys of those who dared to innovate. Because sometimes the best way to create the future is to learn from the past.

🚀 Goal: To lead a tech company that redefines what it means to be human-centered. A place where groundbreaking solutions and infectious passion unite to shape a better tomorrow.

🤝 Connect with me: Let's exchange ideas, unlock possibilities, and build something extraordinary together. Catch me on @bigboytimi or find my musings on Medium.

I'm ready to code the future. Are you?
